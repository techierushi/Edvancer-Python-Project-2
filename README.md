<h2> To Mail or Not to Mail </h2>
<ul>
<li>
Direct mailings to a company’s potential customers – “junk mail” to many – can be a very effective
way for them to market a product or a service. However, as we all know, much of this junk mail is
really of no interest to the people that receive it. Most of it ends up thrown away, not only wasting
the money that the company spent on it, but also filling up landfill waste sites or needing to be
  recycled.</li><br>
<li>If the company had a better understanding of who their potential customers were, they would
know more accurately who to send it to, so some of this waste and expense could be reduced.

<h3> Formal Problem Statement </h3>
We want you to predict whether a customer is interested in a caravan insurance policy from other
data about the customer. Information about customers consists of 86 variables and includes
product usage data and socio-demographic data derived from zip area codes. The data was
supplied based on a real world business problem.<br>
The training set contains over 5000 descriptions of customers, including the information of whether or not they have a caravan
insurance policy. A test set contains 4000 customers of whom target variable is not shared with
you.

<b><li>Target Variable is V86</li></b>
